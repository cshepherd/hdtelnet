# HD Telnet

Goals (kinda in order):
- Use Wiznet 5100 TCP offloading - DONE
- Support for 80-column and VidHD-specific wide-carriage text modes - DONE
- Connect to any DNS name / ip address on any port - almost DONE
- VT100 emulation (subset)
- Limited character substitutions (mousetext for ANSI where it makes good sense)
- Card slot detection and network configuration via DHCP
